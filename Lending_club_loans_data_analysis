In this data analysis project, I utilized PostgreSQL to do data cleaning, data manipulation, and data normalization. The purpose of this project loan data analysis was to deepen my understanding on loans data and visualization techniques, and to showcase my ability to derive meaningful insights. The insights generated from this project are valuable for providing actionable data for stakeholders. The dataset is accepted loans data from Lending Club Loan that I downloaded from kaggle.

The analysis focused on several key questions:

What is the total loan amount issued?
How many loans are fully paid, currently active, charged off, or delayed?
What are the average interest rates across different loan grades?
What are the trends in loan issuance and interest rates over time?
How is the loan amount distributed across different categories?
What insights can we gather from the relationship between interest rates and loan grades?
What are the primary purposes for which loans are issued?
How do average interest rates correlate with loan amounts?
