## Global Retailer Data Analysis Project
In this data analysis project, I utilized PostgreSQL to analyze a coffee shop transaction dataset. The dataset was downloaded on Kaggle. The analysis focused on key questions such as regarding sales and analyzing performance of different stores in different locations. See the SQL queries here [coffee_shop_data_analysis](./coffee_data_queries.sql)

The analysis focused on several key questions:  
1. How much are the total sales per year?
2. How do sales compare across different coffee shops?
3. What is the sales contribution of each product category?
4. What are the total sales and quantities sold per product?
5. How do sales vary by month?
6. What are the top-performing products by sales each month?
7. What are the top-performing products at each store location?
8. What is the average number of daily transactions per month?
9. What are the total sales for each day of the week?
10. What is the monthly sales change rate for each store location?
