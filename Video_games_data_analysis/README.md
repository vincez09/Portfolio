## Video Games Dataset Data Analysis Project
In this data analysis project I will be using **python pandas for data cleaning and manipulation** and **python matplotlib for data visualization**. I analyzed a video games dataset downloaded from Kaggle. See the code here [Video Games Data Analysis Notebook](./video_games_analysis.ipynb)

The analysis focused on several key questions:  
1. What are the top video games to date?
2. Which video games have the high number of plays?
3. What genres are popular to the people?
4. What is the correlation between the rating and the number of plays?
5. Does higher rating means higher number of plays?
6. What is the distribution of game ratings?
