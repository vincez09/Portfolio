## Global Retailer Data Analysis Project
In this data analysis project I will be using **sqlite3** and **python(matplotlib) for data visualization**. I analyzed a global retailer dataset downloaded from Maven Analytics. The dataset was stored in a **SQLite3 database**, followed by data cleaning and manipulation to ensure accuracy and consistency. See the code here [Global Retailer Data Analysis Notebook](./Global_retailer_data_analysis.ipynb)

The analysis focused on several key questions:  
1. How much is the total quantity sold, total sales, and profit
2. Which sales channel perform better?
3. How is the sales per month?
4. What are the most profitable products?
5. What are top 10 performing stores and its location?
6. How many new customers per year?
7. What is the age distribution of customers?
8. Which age group buys the most? 

**Visualizations were created using Matplotlib** to provide clear insights into the data. Finally, I prepared dataframes for import into Tableau to create a Global Retail Sales Dashboard, which can be viewed here [Global Retailer Sales Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/steven.vincent.zabala/viz/Global_retailer_dashboard/DashboardFinal)
